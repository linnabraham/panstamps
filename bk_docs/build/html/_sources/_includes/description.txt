*A python package and command-line tools to download stacked and/or warp image stamps from the STScI PanSTARRS image server*.

.. note:: 

    If working with warped PS1 images then you need to work off a machine that has an IP address whitelisted by the `Pan-STARRS1 data archive <https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/>`_, otherwise only stacked images will be available to you. Also *w*-band images are not (yet) accessible from the data archive.

Here's a summary of what's included in the python package:
